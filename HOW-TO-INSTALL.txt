INSTALLATION:

    1. Extract the contents of the "L.A.Noire" directory into the root of
       your L.A. Noire installation (same location as LaNoire.exe).

    2. Done. No other special setup is required.

    IMPORTANT: Do not forget to extract all of the files, including the
    "plugins" directory. If this step is missed, then V-Patch will not be
    loaded.

LINUX INSTALLATION:

    Use the same steps as above in addition to the following guide by Silent:
    https://cookieplmonster.github.io/setup-instructions/#proton-wine

FEATURES:

    - TOTAL FPS UNCAP: V-Patch completely removes the default 30 FPS limit and
      allows the game to be run completely uncapped by implementing an improved
      FPS cap removal method, which also doesn't suffer from side effects such
      as the game simulation running at incorrect speeds!

    - FPS-RELATED FIXES: The patch also addresses FPS-related bugs, such as car
      braking issues or the infamous pencil bug in the case "The Set Up".

    - UNLOCKED ASPECT RATIOS: Added support for more aspect ratios. The black
      bars on 16:10, 4:3 or 5:4 have been removed and the game and its UI now
      uses your whole screen.

    - ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT: Support for Ultrawide resolutions using built-in FoV
      and UI correction.

    - BORDERLESS WINDOW: The game now runs in a borderless window by default,
      which allows you to alt-tab faster and also has the effect of disabling
      v-sync.

    - CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS: The addition of a number of customization options
      like the ability to set a custom FoV, a custom FPS cap or disabling the
      intro logos.

CONFIGURATION:

    Locate the plugins folder in your game's directory and open the lanvp.ini
    configuration file. Here you can enable/disable or change any of the
    features mentioned above.

    An explanatory comment is included above each option, just in case you get
    lost ;)

KNOWN ISSUES:

    - Car steering is more sensitive than it should be.

    - On very high FPS (100+), the chandelier in the case 
      "The Quarter Moon Murders" can break. If you encounter this issue,
      temporarily disable the patch or lower your FPS limit to below 100.

CHANGELOG:

    v2.0 (August 8th, 2024):
        - Patch rewritten from scratch.
        - Fixed the infamous pencil FPS bug in the case "The Set Up".
        - Reworked the implementation of the FPS patch. UI elements will now
          fade in/out at the right speed and have the correct mouse
          sensitivity. Also, the game will now correctly pause if alt-tabbed
          (unless the -ignorefocus option is specified).
        - Fixed the speed of pigeons when they take off on high FPS.
        - Fixed problems with changing the resolution of the game when the
          Aspect ratio fix was enabled. Also, black bars will no longer
          re-appear.
        - Fixed FoV blending problems on ultrawide aspect ratios.
        - Fixed the behaviour of FoV correction in cutscenes on ultrawide
